# Patient_Consent_using_AR
Informed consent, a pre-surgical process where a health care provider educates a patient about the available treatment plan and acquires permission from the patient, is traditionally delivered through an oral explanation based on the patient’s medical images, such as a CT scan (Shah et al. 2022). To facilitate this process and improve the quality of consent, we use an augmented reality (AR) environment, mounted on Microsoft HoloLens, to visualize and explain the treatment plan/s available to the patient. However, exhibiting the 3D medical images to the patient might not produce any notable improvements, as it still requires the doctor to make detailed explanations that might confuse the patient. Thus, it needs to be further developed so that the doctor’s explanation can be visualized, and the patient can have options to interact with objects in the AR environment.
